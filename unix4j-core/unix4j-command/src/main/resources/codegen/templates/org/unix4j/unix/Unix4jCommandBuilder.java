/**
 * Builder for a <b>unix4j</b> command or a chain of joined commands. 
 * Application code does usually not directly refer to this class but uses it 
 * indirectly through the static methods in {@link org.unix4j.Unix4j Unix4j}.
 * <p>
 * Note that the command creation methods do not return a new command instance.
 * Instead, the builder stores the created commands and only returns a 
 * {@link Command} object when the {@link #build()} method is invoked. Most
 * applications, however, need not to call {@code build()} explicitly. The
 * command can be built and executed in a single step by calling one of the 
 * {@code toXXX(..)} methods, such as {@link #toStdOut()}, 
 * {@link #toFile(String)} or {@link #toStringResult()}. 
 * <p>
 * The {@link Command} object returned by the {@link #build()} method can
 * represent a single command or a chain of commands. In a command chain, the
 * previous command usually pipes its output as standard input into the
 * next command (the pipe symbol between two commands in unix). For come 
 * commands, however, chaining has a different interpretation. An example is the
 * {@code xargs} command: here, the next command after {@code xargs} receives 
 * <i>arguments</i> from {@code xargs} instead of (standard) input.
